# Cybersecurity Demos
This repository contains interactive, educational demos of common cybersecurity threats.

## Purpose
To raise awareness through simple web-based demos and help users understand how cyber threats work in practice.

## Projects
- **Phishing: URL Lookalike Attack**  
  `phishing-url-lookalike/` — Simulates a fake login page using a spoofed domain to demonstrate how users can be tricked by typo-squatting.

- **Credential Stuffing**
`credential_stuffing/` — Simulates a fake login page that has strict security measures for passwords (length, special characters, etc).
  **!!** When running simulation, passwords such as "123456", "password", "qwerty123", etc. will automatically prompt a pop-up of shame, warning users to not use such passwords.
