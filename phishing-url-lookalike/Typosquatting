Typosquatting is a type of online scam where attackers register domain names that are misspellings or close variations of legitimate websites. 
When users mistype a URL, they may be redirected to the malicious site, where they could be exposed to malware, phishing scams, or other harmful activities. 

How can you prevent being misled by typosquatting? Accoring to the professionals at Microsoft(c), you can do the following:
-Whenever possible go to your important sites like banking, social media, or shopping from your own saved favorites, rather than by typing them into the address bar of the browser each time.
-If you do have to type an address into the address bar, type carefully and double-check that what you typed matches the address you intended to go to before you continue.
-If you're typing in an address you've gone to before, your browser may offer to complete the address for you. Give it a quick look, but it's usually safer to accept that suggestion.
-Never click a link you weren't expecting in an email or other message, even if it appears to come from a trusted person or organization.
-If you have to click on a link, look carefully at the address it's going to take you to. Usually just hovering your mouse pointer over the address will show you what address the link will really take you to.
-Watch for subtle spelling differences such as "woodgrowebank.com" instead of "woodgrovebank.com" or letters that have been substituted for numbers such as "c0ntoso.com". Adding, or removing, an "s" at the end of the domain name is another common trick.
-There may also be less-subtle differences, like adding a word or some punctuation to a legitimate domain name. "woodgrove-bank.com" or "thewoodgrovebank.com" are two examples of how typosquatters may try to trick you into visiting a fake versions of the woodgrovebank.com website.
